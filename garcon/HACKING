Bug tracking system
===================

garcon uses the bug tracking system at http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
hosted and maintained by the Xfce project.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the Xfce bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified
diff format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Git master branch are most preferable. You can always
access the master branch from 

  http://git.xfce.org/libs/garcon/


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product garcon) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported
already before; requesting a feature several times won't increase
the chance that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is necessary!


Release process
===============

  1) Check out a fresh copy from Git
  2) Increment the version number in configure.in.in and the major version
     number of the library whenever new functions got added.
  3) Update NEWS and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add a note about the new
     release to ChangeLog, so people can see which changes appeared in which
     release.
  4) Check the gtk-doc.
  5) Run make update-po in po/ and update po/de.po (don't forget the header)!
  6) Unset garcon_version_tag in configure.in.in and reset it after the
     release is done.
  7) Verify that make dist works.
  8) "git commit -a" the changes.
  9) Create a simple tag for the release.
 10) Upload the tarballs to xfce.org
 11) Upload the new online documentation to www.xfce.org.

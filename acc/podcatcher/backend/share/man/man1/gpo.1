.TH GPO "1" "May 2015" "gpodder 4.6.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
gpo \- gPodder command-line interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpo
[\fI--verbose|-v\fR]
[\fICOMMAND\fR] [\fIparams...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
gpo is the text mode interface to gPodder. gPodder downloads and manages free
audio and video content ("podcasts") for you. Run it without any arguments to
start the interactive shell, then type "help" for an overview of commands.

.SH INTERACTIVE SHELL MODE
.PP
If you run "gpo" without \fICOMMAND\fR it will enter its interactive shell
mode. From there, you can type commands directly. When readline is available,
this shell supports completion using <Tab>. Podcast feed URLs are also
completed for commands that take the URL of a podcast as argument.

.SH COMMAND PREFIXES
.PP
For all commands, you can use only the first few characters instead of the
full command, as long as the command is unique. If not, gpo will show you all
matching commands and the shortest prefix of each.
.PP
Please note that future additions to the command set could change the shortest
prefix of any given command, so usage of the full command in scripts is
recommended (e.g. use "gpo update" and not "gpo up" in scripts and cronjobs).
The short command prefixes are mostly useful for interactive usage.

.SH QUERYING USING EQL
.PP
Using the
.I query
command allows you to use the full range of Episode Query Language expressions
that gPodder supports. Combined with the
.I apply
command, this can be very powerful.
.PP
For example, you can mark all episodes that
are videos, not yet downloaded, smaller than 10 MB and released in the last 7
days as new like this (in the interactive shell mode):
.PP
.RS 4
.B query video and not downloaded and mb < 10 and since < 7
.PP
.B apply mark new
.RE
.PP
Similarly, you can mark all new episodes as old with a combination of:
.PP
.RS 4
.B query new
.PP
.B apply mark old
.RE
.PP
Delete all downloaded episodes that have been downloaded more than 15 days ago:
.PP
.RS 4
.B query downloaded and age > 15
.PP
.B apply rm
.RE
.PP
And finally, download all audio files that are shorter than 30 minutes and that
are not yet downloaded:
.PP
.RS 4
.B query audio and minutes < 30 not downloaded
.PP
.B apply fetch
.RE

  when creating multiple new channels with the same name, but
  in that case channels singletons should be used.

  things up a bit on app startup, and avoid blocking waiting on DBus
  in other cases.
- New simpler (internal) handling of property bindings.
- Use new xdt macros, this requires xfce-dev-tools 4.7.2.
- New tests for object bindings.
- Updated translations: es, kk, ca, sv, hu, ro, gl, ja, cs, lv, ast,
  zh_CN, ur, ur_PK, da, eu, pt.


4.6.2
=====

4.6.1
=====
- Be a bit safer when writing out channel xml files: flush data to disk
  using fdatasync()/fsync() before renaming over the old file.
- Updated translations: pl, es, it, gl, pl, pt, uk


4.6.0
=====
- Remove unimplemented --import and --export functions from xfconf-query
- Fix encoding bug with xfconf-query input (Bug #4622)
- Updated translations: ba, ca, cs, da, de, en_GB, es, fr, gl, hu, id, it, ja,
  nb, pl, pt_PT, sv, tr, zh_CN


4.5.99.1
========
- Don't translate "true" and "false" in the xfconf-query output.
- Updated translations (cs, da, fi, fr, nl, pt_BR, sv, zh_CN)


4.5.93
======
- Install xfconfd to $(libexecdir) instead of $(bindir).
- Fix perl bindings link order on Cygwin (bug 4735).
- Allow passing arbitrary options to the perl bindings' Makefile.PL
  generation script (bug 4735).
- Updated translations: Michal Várady (cs), SZERVÁC Attila (hu),
  Daniel Nylander (sv), Terje Uriansrud (nb), Carles Muñoz Gorriz (ca),
  Abel Martín (es), Maximilian Schleiss (fr), Og Maciel (pt_BR),
  Eren Turkay (tr)


4.5.92
======
- Add xfconf_channel_new_with_property_base() to restrict a channel
  to a subset of the property tree.
- Add a dbus message filter to xfconfd that catches dbus daemon
  disconnect signals and flushes channels before xfconfd gets
  killed (bug 4487).
- Change libxfconf GObject bindings API slightly to use gulong IDs
  for each binding to be used when removing bindings.  Extend the
  unbind functions a bit.
- Bump libxfconf interface version due to incompatible change.
- Add libxfconf perl bindings.
- Remove xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
  xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
- Only treat the XML file under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME as a "user" file,
  and treat all others as system files.  This fixes the problem where
  Xfce-installed defaults get read *after* the user's config when
  Xfce is installed to a user-writable prefix (bug 4592).
- Fix build on Cygwin and other platforms that actually care about
  library link order (bug 4559).


4.5.91
======
- Remove xfsettingsd (moved to xfce4-settings package).  This removes
  xfconf's gtk+ dependency entirely.
- Add xfconf_channel_get() which returns an XfconfChannel singleton
  object that lives until calling xfconf_shutdown().
- Add xfconf_channel_reset_property(), which is a replacement for the
  'remove' functions.  This more accurately describes what 'remove'
  actually does in the presence of locked properties and/or properties
  that have system-wide defaults.
- Deprecate xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
  xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
- Change D-Bus interface to reflect above two changes.
- Add IsPropertyLocked() to the D-Bus interface, as well as a
  corresponding xfconf_channel_is_property_locked() libxfconf function,
  which allows clients to query whether or not a property can be
  modified.
- Don't send out a PropertyChange signal if a property is set to the
  value it already held.
- Fix daemon crash when resetting properties recursively.
- Fix daemon sending incorrect property names in the PropertyRemoved
  signal when removing multiple properties at once.
- For GObject property bindings, if the bound xfconf property is
  removed from the config store, try to reset the GObject property
  to the default value specified in its GParamSpec.
- Add -R option to xfconf-query which causes the -r option (reset) to
  operate recursively to include all properties under the specified
  property.
- Add -a option to xfconf-query which forces setting a property as an
  array even if the array only has one element.
- Fix xfconf_channel_get_property() so it properly converts the value
  fetched from the config store into the type that the caller
  requested (if any).


4.5.90
======
- Initial release.  There are bugs, and the API and ABI are not frozen.
